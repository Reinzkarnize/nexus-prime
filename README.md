> **"Learning is a mission, not a chore."**

**NEXUS PRIME** is a web-based Learning Management System (LMS) designed with a high-fidelity **Cyberpunk & Gaming UI** aesthetic (inspired by Valorant & Overwatch). This project re-imagines the standard video learning experience, turning it into a tactical mission.
